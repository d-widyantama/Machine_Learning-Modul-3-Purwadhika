# Module 3 - Excercise 1 - Linear Regression 

In this notebook, we will try to apply the simple linear regression to TLC Dataset about NYC Taxis.

The Dataset contains trip record information for each taxi and for-hire vehicle trip completed by TLC licensed drivers and vehicles.
We will try to use the Fare Amount and Trip Distance data to build linear regression model to predict the amount of tips will be received by the driver.

## Overview
In general the steps included in the notebook will covers:
1. Data Understanding and Overview
2. Data Cleaning
3. Applying Linear Regression
    - 3.1 Simple Linear Regression
    - 3.2 Multiple Linear Regression

## Initial Assumptions & Notes 
- This notebook only serves as an excercise and focusing on the application on simple linear regression
- The data cleaning method used in the data are somewhat "brute-force" by dropping all the non-conforming data to regression model
- Train and test data sampling are **not used** in this project
